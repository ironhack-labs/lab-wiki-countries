##  Test Your Code

This lab is equipped with unit tests to provide automated feedback on your progress and help you understand whether your code is working as expected. If you want to check the tests, they are located in the `src/test` folder.


### Iterations and Test Results

During an iteration, if your code seems to work as expected but some tests don't pass, feel free to move on to the next iteration. Once you've completed all the mandatory iterations, you can go back and resolve any remaining failed test

<br>

### Run the Tests

1. To execute the tests, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```shell
  npm run test
  ```

2. The above command will execute the tests and open the `@vitest/ui` Test Reporter in the browser. 

3. To see the test results, **open** [http://127.0.0.1:51204/\_\_vitest\_\_](http://127.0.0.1:51204/__vitest__) in your browser.

<br>

## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | Getting Started

#### Install Dependencies

The application you will create in this exercise will use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and React Router for setting up multiple pages and handling navigation.

To begin, install the Bootstrap and React Router packages:

```shell
npm install react-router-dom bootstrap
```

<br>

To make the Bootstrap styles available in the entire app, import the Bootstrap stylesheet at the top of the `src/main.jsx` file:

```javascript
// src/main.jsx
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
```

<br>

#### Countries API

The [Countries API](https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries) you will use in this exercise provides two endpoints listed in the table below. You can refer to this section any time during the exercise for information about the API endpoints and their usage.

**Base URL**: https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/countries`             | Get a list of all countries                            |
| `GET`  | `/countries/:alpha3Code` | Get details for a specific country by its `alpha3Code` |

<br>

---

### Iteration 1 | Create Components

In this iteration, we will focus on the general layout by creating components. Inside the `src` folder, we have two separate folders named `components` and `pages`, one used for storing all the individual components and the other for storing the complete pages.

Create the following components in their respective folders:

**Components Folder:**

- **`src/components/Navbar.jsx`**: The `Navbar` component should display a `nav` element with the text "WikiCountries".

<br>

**Pages Folder:**

- **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: The `HomePage` component should initially display a headline with the text "WikiCountries: Your Guide to the World".
  <br>

- **`src/pages/CountryDetailsPage.jsx`**: The `CountryDetailsPage` component should initially display a headline with the text "Country Details".

<br>

**Layout and Styling**

We have included examples of each page in the `examples`. The example code uses Bootstrap classes for layout and styling.

If you decide to copy the code provided in the `examples` folder, keep the following in mind:

  - In React, the HTML attribute `class` is written as `className`

  - For inline CSS, use a JavaScript object and name each CSS property in camelCase (more details [here](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#applying-css-styles)). For example, if you have a `p` element with the `style` attribute:

    ```html
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">Example</p>
    ```

    In React and JSX, you would write it as:

    ```jsx
    <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Example</p>
    ```

<br>

  <sub> Note: Structure and content copied from the "examples" folder</sub>
  <br>

</details>

<br>

---

### Iteration 2 | Setup React Router and Create Routes

After creating the components, it is time to take the next step and set up React Router to handle navigation and create multiple pages in your app.

1. Set up React Router in your `src/main.jsx` file:

```jsx
// src/main.jsx
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>
);
```

<br>

2. In your `App.jsx` set up two routes that render the following pages:

- Route `/`, which renders the `HomePage` component
- Route `/:countryId`, which renders the `CountryDetailsPage` component

<br>

Once you set up the routes, your app should render two pages as shown in the expected result below.

<details>

  <summary><b>See Expected Result</b></summary>

  <br>

</details>

<br>

### Iteration 3 | Fetch Countries Data and Display as a List

In this iteration, you will work on the `HomePage` component to retrieve the countries data from the Countries API and render it as a list.

To do this, you must use React hooks, specifically:

- `useState` to create a state variable to store the countries data retrieved from the API
- `useEffect` to set an effect that will make a `GET` request to the API for the countries data

<br>

The endpoint https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries returns a JSON response in the form of an _array_ containing the data of all the countries in the world. You should use `axios` to make a `GET` request to the endpoint. Once you retrieve the response data, store it in a state and then render it as a list of country names.

**Tip:** You should `console.log` the response data to help you visualize the structure of the country objects and how the data is structured.

The rendered list of countries should show the country names.

<details>

  <summary><b>See Expected Result</b></summary>

![home page showing list of country names](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/m3/lab-wikicountries/lab-react-wiki-countries-countries-list-names-only.gif)

  <br>

</details>

<br>

---

### Iteration 4 | Country List with Links

In this iteration, you will make the list of countries you rendered in the previous iteration dynamic by adding clickable `Link`s for each country. Clicking on a `Link` should navigate the user to the country details page.

To do this, update the list of countries and make each list item a React Router [`Link`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link). Each list item should show the country name and the flag. For the small picture of the flag, you can use the lowercase `alpha2Code` and embed it in the URL as shown below:

- France: https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/icon/72x54/fr.png
- Germany: https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/icon/72x54/de.png
- Brazil: https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/icon/72x54/br.png
- etc.

<br>

To allow users to navigate to a specific country's details page, embed the country's `alpha3Code` in the URL for each `Link`. When any of the country links on the `HomePage` are clicked, the `alpha3Code` should show up in the URL, and the user should be navigated to the country details page (`CountryDetailsPage`).

<details>

  <summary><b>See Expected Result</b></summary>

![country list link url parameters](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/m3/lab-wikicountries/lab-react-wiki-countries-countries-list-url-parameters.gif)

  <br>

</details>

<br>

---

### Iteration 5 | Show Country Details

In this iteration, you will work on the `CountryDetailsPage` component to display the information of a specific country.

The Countries API provides access to country-specific data through the endpoint `/countries/:alpha3Code`. The endpoint takes the country's `alpha3Code` and returns a JSON response containing the country info.

Here are a few examples of how to construct the request URL using the country's `alpha3Code`:

- United States: https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries/USA
- Japan: https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries/JPN
- India: https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries/IND

<br>

When any of the country links on the `HomePage` are clicked, the user should be navigated to the `CountryDetailsPage`. The `alpha3Code` of the country will be available through the URL parameters. To retrieve the data for a specific country from the API, you should make a `GET` request to the API using the `alpha3Code`, as explained above.

<br>

#### 5.1 | Access URL Parameters

To access the URL parameters from the browser's URL bar, use the React Router hook `useParams`.

Check [this example](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.10.0/hooks/use-params) if you need a reminder on how to set up the useParams hook and access the URL parameters.

<br>

#### 5.2 | Fetch Country Data

In the `CountryDetailsPage` component, set up an effect using the `useEffect` hook.

Using `axios` inside of the effect, make a `GET` request to the Countries API to retrieve the country data. Once you receive the response, save the data in a state variable.

The effect should run after the initial render and each time that the URL parameter with the `alpha3Code` changes.

<br>

#### 5.3| Display Loading Message While Fetching Data

If you try to access and render a value from a state variable that is `null` or `undefined`, you will get an error. This can happen when data is not yet saved in the state variable, and the state variable still has the initial value of `null` or `undefined`.

Before rendering the country data in the `CountryDetailsPage`, you should first check if it is available. To do this, add a conditional statement that checks if the state variable holding country data is `null` or `undefined`.

If the state variable is `null` or `undefined` the component should display a message saying "Loading" to indicate that the data is being fetched/loaded.

  <br>

</details>

<br>

#### 5.4 | Display Country Details and Borders

Once the country data is retrieved from the Countries API and saved in the state, render the country _name_, _capital_, _area_, and _borders_.

Each border should be a clickable `Link`. To allow users to navigate to a bordering country's details page, embed the `alpha3Code` of each bordering country in the URL of the `Link`.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>I am stuck and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start. What should I do?</summary>

  <br>

If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.

For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources.

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>How do I update a state variable in my React component? How do I use the useState hook in my React component?</summary>

  <br>

To update a state variable in a React component, you should use the `useState` hook. This hook returns an array with two elements: the **current value** of the state variable and a **function to update it**. Here is an example of how to use `useState` to update the `count` state variable:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}> Increment </button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, the `handleClick` function is called when the button is clicked, and it updates the `count` state variable by calling the `setCount` function with the new value: `setCount(count + 1)`.
The component will re-render every time a state variable gets updated.

<details>
  <summary>How do I use the <code>useEffect</code> hook in my React component?</summary>

  <br>

The `useEffect` hook (also called the _Effect hook_) allows you to run your side effects. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, starting a timer, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of common actions (aka _side effects_) that you may want to set up in your components.

The `useEffect` hook allows you to run side effects during all three lifecycle phases:

- **Mounting phase**
- **Update phase**
- **Unmounting phase**

  <br>

##### Syntax

The syntax of the `useEffect` is the following:

```jsx
// Actual syntax
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

As you can see `useEffect` takes two arguments:

```jsx
// Pseudo code:
useEffect(didUpdate, dependencyArray);
```

- `didUpdate` - a function containing the code (side effect) we want to run.
- `dependencyArray` - the array of values that the effect depends on. React watches this array for any change and when a value in this array changes, the effect will run.

  <br>

##### `useEffect` - Mounting phase

We can set the `useEffect` to **run code in the mounting phase**, **only once** right after the component is rendered for the first time.

To do so, we use the `useEffect` hook with the following syntax:

```jsx
// Run the effect only once
// during the mounting phase

useEffect(() => {
  // Do something ...
}, []);
```

The empty array `[]` means that “this effect doesn’t depend on anything”, and will therefore run only once, after the initial render.

  <br>

##### `useEffect` - Unmounting phase

Often, _effects_ create resources that need to be cleaned up before the component leaves the screen, such as a subscription or a timer, like in the previous example. Before the component _unmounts_, we should cancel all remaining processes to prevent memory leaks.

To do this, the function passed to **`useEffect` may return a cleanup function**. Example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Do something ...

  // Returned function is known as a "cleanup function",
  // which React will automatically run
  // right before the component is removed from the DOM
  return () => {
    // Perform clean up actions here
  };
}, []);
```

  <br>

##### `useEffect` - Conditional updates (Update phase)

The `useEffect` hook can also be used to run code during the _Update_ phase, whenever there is an update of state or props.

As you may have noticed, `useEffect` takes a second argument `[]` the _dependency array_. A dependency array is used to specify the values that the effect depends on. Additionally, React keeps track of this array to know if it should re-run the effect. Example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Do something ...
  // Effect will run again if either `a` or `b` change or are updated
}, [a, b]);
```

  <br>

**Important**: Whenever a value specified in the dependency array updates, React re-runs the effect.

For a detailed explanation, check the following documentation pages:

- [React Docs: Synchronizing with Effects](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)
- [React Docs: `useEffect`](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useEffect)

<details>
  <summary>I am getting an error: "not defined". How do I fix it?</summary>

  <br>

The "ReferenceError: variable is not defined" error in JavaScript occurs when you try to access a variable or a function that has not been defined yet or is out of scope.

To fix the issue, check that you have defined the variable or function that you are trying to use and double-check the spelling to make sure you are using the correct name.

In case the variable or a function is defined in another file, make sure that the file has been imported or loaded correctly.

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>

  <br>

There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to _push_ changes to a Git repository:

1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

<br>

2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a _Fork_ first, you do not have write access to the repository.
   To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   <br>

   If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first, and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

   **Note**: You may want to make a copy of the code you have locally, to avoid losing it in the process.
